A Grade Book Analyser is a computer-based system designed to efficiently record, calculate, and evaluate students’ academic performance.
Instead of manually writing marks and computing grades, this analyser automates the entire process. 
It stores students’ scores, calculates totals and averages, assigns grades, and generates performance reports.
